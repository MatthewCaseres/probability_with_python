Let $T$ be the set of tennis players and $H$ be the set of hockey players. $(T \\cap H)^C$ is the set of people that don't play both tennis and hockey. $T^C \\cup H^C$ is people that don't play tennis or they don't play hockey. If I don't play both sports then I either don't play tennis or I don't play hockey, so $(T \\cap H)^C \\subseteq T^C \\cup H^C$. If I don't play tennis or I don't play hockey then it is true that I don't play both sports, so $T^C \\cup H^C \\subseteq (T \\cap H)^C$. This means that the sets are equal, ponder this for some time. A similar argument can be made for the complement of the union.
